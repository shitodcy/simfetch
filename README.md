## üìã Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

-   **`bash`** v4.0+
-   **`chafa`**: For rendering images and ASCII art.
-   **`pciutils`**: Provides the `lspci` command for GPU detection.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Nerd Font Required**
>
> `simfetch` uses icons that are only available in Nerd Fonts. If you do not have a Nerd Font installed and configured in your terminal, the icons will not display correctly and may appear as empty boxes (`‚ñØ`) or random symbols.
>
> You can download a suitable font from the official **[Nerd Fonts Website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)**.

You can typically install `chafa` and `pciutils` with your package manager:

#### For Debian based

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install chafa pciutils
```

#### For Arch Linux / Manjaro

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu chafa pciutils
```

#### For Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install chafa pciutils-devel
```

#### For openSUSE

```bash
sudo zypper install chafa pciutils
```

## üöÄ Installation

Installing `simfetch` is easy. The installer script handles everything for you.

### 1\. Download the Scripts
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shitodcy/simfetch
cd simfetcb
```

### 2\. Run the Installer

Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the installer:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

The installer will make the `simfetch` script executable and move it to `~/.local/bin/`, making it available as a system-wide command for your user.

### 3\. Final Step

Close and reopen your terminal to ensure your shell recognizes the new command. If the `simfetch` command is still not found, you may need to add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## üíª Usage

After a successful installation, simply open your terminal and type:

```bash
simfetch
```

The script will display your system information. Enjoy\!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Converting ASCII to image is quite easy.

### 1. Open the Configuration File

Open a terminal and run the following command to edit the configuration file using the `nano` text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.local/bin/simfetch
```

-----

### 2. Change ASCII mode to image

Inside the editor, you will find the variable `DISPLAY_MODE="ascii"`. By default, this variable points to an ASCII logo file, but if you want to change it to an image, simply change it to something like this:

```bash
DISPLAY_MODE="image"
```

To display your custom image, simply change this path to the full absolute path of your image file. For example:

```bash
IMAGE_PATH="/home/jhon/Pictures/cat.png"
```

The `simfetch` script will automatically detect that the path points to the image and display it correctly.


### 3. Running simfetch

```bash
simfetch
```

The script will display your system information using custom image. Enjoy\!
